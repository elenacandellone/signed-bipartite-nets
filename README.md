## Paper abstract

Decision-making processes often involve voting. Human interactions with exogenous entities such as legislations or products, can be effectively modeled as two-mode (bipartite) signed networks. These networks exhibit both positive and negative connections between two types of nodesâ€”humans and entities. While detecting communities is an established practice separately for bipartite and signed networks, it remains largely unexplored in the case of bipartite signed networks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of community detection methods on bipartite signed networks using a synthetic benchmark and real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that when no communities are present in the data, these methods often recover spurious communities, and their performance is susceptible to parameter choices. When communities are present, the algorithms exhibit promising performance. This indicates that researchers using community detection methods in the context of bipartite signed networks should not take the communities found at face value.
