# Community detection on signed networks: untangling co-voting patterns on online social media

## Abstract

Community detection has been a widely studied problem in network science over the last few decades. Scholars have developed methods that consider several network properties, such as the strength of interactions quantified as an edge weight. Signed networks are a generalization of weighted networks, allowing for both positive and negative interactions. Due to the existence of a few community detection methods in the literature suitable for signed networks, we have created a pipeline to test their effectiveness in the case of bipartite networks with positive and negative links.
Signed bipartite networks are prevalent in various domains, including social media interactions and political voting processes. Existing research on signed bipartite networks has primarily focused on defining Structural Balance within a bipartite network, leaving a gap in understanding community detection on such networks.  We develop a benchmark featuring synthetic data and real-data signed bipartite networks with known divisions. The benchmark is devoted to evaluating the accuracy of community detection methods. This work tests the benchmark on datasets from the US House of Representatives votes and the Menéame social media platform. The study aims to contribute to the understanding of signed bipartite networks, particularly in the context of social media interactions, where negative interactions are often overlooked.
We find that existing community detection methods correctly capture synthetic-generated scenarios under parameter tuning, while they yield discordant results on Menéame data. In contrast, they correctly identify political parties in the US House of Representatives co-voting networks.
