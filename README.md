# Community detection on signed networks: untangling co-voting patterns on online social media

## Abstract

In the last decades, the pervasive presence of online micro-blogging platforms has revolutionized the way we communicate. With the emergence of the World Wide Web, a significant portion of political discourse has migrated to online media, connecting individuals across countries and diverse perspectives. While these technological advancements have facilitated the exchange of ideas and opinions, they have also given rise to the subtle and ambiguous dissemination of misinformation and propaganda. Consequently, it is crucial to investigate the dynamics of opinion formation and evolution on social media, with a specific focus on identifying inauthentic behaviors and self-organized groups that aim to propagate false information.

In this study, we employ a variety of community detection methods specifically designed for analyzing signed networks, characterized by the presence of positive and negative edges. Our objective is to uncover distinct communities within the network and explore the relationship between network topology and the sociological interpretation of these communities. To determine the most suitable community detection algorithm for real-world scenarios, we devise a pipeline that involves simulating networks with similar structural properties to the actual network.

As a real-world application, we utilize a dataset obtained from a Spanish microblogging platform called Men√©ame. From this dataset, we construct a co-voting network where a positive edge is created between users if they vote in the same manner on a post, and a negative edge is established if they react differently.
Through our research, we aim to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between online communication patterns and the formation of opinion-based communities. The insights gained from this investigation will contribute to the development of effective strategies for mitigating the spread of false information and promoting a more informed and reliable online discourse.
